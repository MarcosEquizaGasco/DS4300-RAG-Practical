Notes and Examples AVL Trees httpsicsucieduthorntonics46NotesAVLTrees 57', 'Inserting a key into an AVL tree starts out the same way as insertion into a binary search tree Perform a lookup If you find the key already in the tree youre done because keys in a binary search tree must be unique When the lookup terminates without the key being found add a new node in the appropriate leaf position where the lookup ended The problem is that adding the new node introduced the possibility of an imbalance For example suppose we started with this AVL tree and then we inserted the key 35 into it A binary search tree insertion would give us this as a result But this resulting tree is not an AVL tree because the node containing the key 40 does not have the AVL property because the difference in the heights of its subtrees is 2 Its left subtree has height 1 its right subtree — which is empty — has height 1 What can we do about it The answer lies in the following algorithm which we perform after the normal insertion process Work your way back up the tree from the position where you just added a node This could be quite simple if the insertion was done recursively Compare the heights of the left and right subtrees of each node When they differ by more than 1 choose a rotation that will fix the imbalance Note that comparing the heights of the left and right subtrees would be quite expensive if you didnt already know what they were The solution to this problem is for each node to store its height ie the height of the subtree rooted there This can be cheaply updated after every insertion or removal as you unwind the recursion The rotation is chosen considering the two links along the path below the node where the imbalance is heading back down toward where you inserted a node If you were wondering where the names LL RR LR and RL come from this is the answer to that mystery If the two links are both to the left perform an LL rotation rooted where the imbalance is If the two links are both to the right perform an RR rotation rooted where the imbalance is If the first link is to the left and the second is to the right perform an LR rotation rooted where the imbalance is If the first link is to the right and the second is to the left perform an RL rotation rooted where the imbalance is It can be shown that any one of these rotations — LL RR LR or RL — will correct any imbalance brought on by inserting a key In this case wed perform an LR rotation — the first two links leading from 40 down toward 35 are a Left and a Right — rooted at 40 which would correct the imbalance and the tree would be rearranged to look like this Compare this to the', 'After the rotation we see what wed expect The node B which in our example contained 35 is now the root of the newlyrotated subtree The node A which in our example contained 30 is now the left child of the root of the newlyrotated subtree The node C which in our example contained 40 is now the right child of the root of the newlyrotated subtree The four subtrees T1 T2 T3 and T4 were all empty so they are still empty Note too that the tree is more balanced after the rotation than it was before This is no accident a single rotation LL RR LR or RL is all thats necessary to correct an imbalance introduced by the insertion algorithm A removal algorithm Removals are somewhat similar to insertions in the sense that you would start with the usual binary search tree removal algorithm then find and correct imbalances while the recursion unwinds The key difference is that removals can require more than one rotation to correct imbalances but will still only require rotations on the path back up to the root from where the removal occurred — so generally Olog n rotations Asymptotic analysis The key question here is What is the height of an AVL tree with n nodes If the answer is Θlog n then we can be certain that lookups insertions and removals will take Olog n time How can we be so sure Lookups would be Olog n because theyre the same as they are in a binary search tree that doesnt have the AVL property If the height of the tree is Θlog n lookups will run in Olog n time Insertions and removals despite being slightly more complicated in an AVL tree do their work by traversing a single path in the tree — potentially all the way down to a leaf position then all the way back up If the length of the longest path — thats what the height of a tree is — is Θlog n then we know that none of these paths is longer than that so insertions and removals will take Olog n time So were left with that key question What is the height of an AVL tree with n nodes If youre not curious you can feel free to just assume this if you want to know more keep reading What is the height of an AVL tree with n nodes Optional The answer revolves around noting how many nodes at minimum could be in a binary search tree of height n and still have it be an AVL tree It turns out AVL trees of height n ≥ 2 that have the minimum number of nodes in them all share a similar property The AVL tree with height h ≥ 2 with the minimum number of nodes consists of a root node with two subtrees one of which is an AVL tree with height h − 1 with the minimum number', 'a root node and empty subtrees would then be zero But what about a tree thats totally empty To maintain a clear pattern relative to other tree heights well say that the height of an empty tree is 1 This means that a node with say a childless left child and no right child would still be considered balanced This leads us finally to the definition of an AVL tree An AVL tree is a binary search tree in which all nodes have the AVL property Below are a few binary trees two of which are AVL and two of which are not The thing to keep in mind about AVL is that its not a matter of squinting at a tree and deciding whether it looks balanced Theres a precise definition and the two trees above that dont meet that definition fail to meet it because they each have at least one node marked in the diagrams by a dashed square that doesnt have the AVL property AVL trees by definition are required to meet the balance condition after every operation every time you insert or remove a key every node in the tree should have the AVL property To meet that requirement we need to restructure the tree periodically essentially detecting and correcting imbalance whenever and wherever it happens To do that we need to rearrange the tree in ways that improve its shape without losing the essential ordering property of a binary search tree smaller keys toward the left larger ones toward the right Rotations Rebalancing of AVL trees is achieved using what are called rotations which when used at the proper times efficiently improve the shape of the tree by altering a handful of pointers There are a few kinds of rotations we should first understand how they work then focus our attention on when to use them The first kind of rotation is called an LL rotation which takes the tree on the left and turns it into the tree on the right The circle with A and B written in them are each a single node containing a single key the triangles with T1 T2 and T3 written in them are arbitrary subtrees which may be empty or may contain any number of nodes but which are themselves binary search trees 31025 1001 AM ICS 46 Spring 2022 Notes and Examples AVL Trees httpsicsucieduthorntonics46NotesAVLTrees 37', 'enough balanced for our purposes even if not perfect A good balance condition has two properties The height of a binary search tree meeting the condition is Θlog n It takes Olog n time to rebalance the tree on insertions and removals In other words it guarantees that the height of the tree is still logarithmic which will give us logarithmictime lookups and the time spent rebalancing wont exceed the logarithmic time we would otherwise spend on an insertion or removal when the tree has logarithmic height The cost wont outweigh the benefit Coming up with a balance condition like this on our own is a tall task but we can stand on the shoulders of the giants who came before us with the definition above helping to guide us toward an understanding of whether weve found what were looking for A compromise AVL trees There are a few wellknown approaches for maintaining binary search trees in a state of nearbalance that meets our notion of a good balance condition One of them is called an AVL tree which well explore here Others which are outside the scope of this course include redblack trees which meet our definition of good and splay trees which dont always meet our definition of good but do meet it on an amortized basis but well stick with the one solution to the problem for now AVL trees AVL trees are what you might called nearly balanced binary search trees While they certainly arent as perfectlybalanced as possible they nonetheless achieve the goals weve decided on maintaining logarithmic height at no more than logarithmic cost So what makes a binary search tree nearly balanced enough to be considered an AVL tree The core concept is embodied by something called the AVL property We say that a node in a binary search tree has the AVL property if the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by no more than 1 In other words we tolerate a certain amount of imbalance — heights of subtrees can be slightly different but no more than that — in hopes that we can more efficiently maintain it Since were going to be comparing heights of subtrees theres one piece of background we need to consider Recall that the height of a tree is the length of its longest path By definition the height of a tree with just a root node and empty subtrees would then be zero But what about a tree thats totally empty To maintain a clear pattern relative to other tree heights well say that the height of an empty tree is 1 This means that a node with say a childless left child and no right child would still be considered balanced This leads us finally to the definition of an AVL tree An AVL tree is a binary search tree in which all nodes have the AVL property Below are a few binary trees two of which are AVL and two of', 'Its important to remember that both of these trees — before and after — are binary search trees the rotation doesnt harm the ordering of the keys in nodes because the subtrees T1 T2 and T3 maintain the appropriate positions relative to the keys A and B All keys in T1 are smaller than A All keys in T2 are larger than A and smaller than B All keys in T3 are larger than B Performing this rotation would be a simple matter of adjusting a few pointers — notably a constant number of pointers no matter how many nodes are in the tree which means that this rotation would run in Θ1 time Bs parent would now point to A where it used to point to B As right child would now be B instead of the root of T2 Bs left child would now be the root of T2 instead of A A second kind of rotation is an RR rotation which makes a similar adjustment Note that an RR rotation is the mirror image of an LL rotation A third kind of rotation is an LR rotation which makes an adjustment thats slightly more complicated An LR rotation requires five pointer updates instead of three but this is still a constant number of changes and runs in Θ1 time Finally there is an RL rotation which is the mirror image of an LR rotation Once we understand the mechanics of how rotations work were one step closer to understanding AVL trees But these rotations arent arbitrary theyre used specifically to correct imbalances that are detected after insertions or removals An insertion algorithm 31025 1001 AM ICS 46 Spring 2022 Notes and Examples AVL Trees httpsicsucieduthorntonics46NotesAVLTrees 47', '3\\u200b

answer revolves around noting how many nodes at minimum could be in a binary search tree of height n and still have it be an AVL tree It turns out AVL trees of height n ≥ 2 that have the minimum number of nodes in them all share a similar property The AVL tree with height h ≥ 2 with the minimum number of nodes consists of a root node with two subtrees one of which is an AVL tree with height h − 1 with the minimum number of nodes the other of which is an AVL tree with height h − 2 with the minimum number of nodes Given that observation we can write a recurrence that describes the number of nodes at minimum in an AVL tree of height h M0 1 When height is 0 minimum number of nodes is 1 a root node with no children M1 2 When height is 1 minimum number of nodes is 2 a root node with one child and not the other Mh 1 Mh 1 Mh 2 While the repeated substitution technique we learned previously isnt a good way to try to solve this particular recurrence we can prove something interesting quite easily We know for sure that AVL trees with larger heights have a bigger minimum number of nodes than AVL trees with smaller heights — thats fairly selfexplanatory — which means that we can be sure that 1 Mh − 1 ≥ Mh − 2 Given that we can conclude the following Mh ≥ 2Mh 2 We can then use the repeated substitution technique to determine a lower bound for this recurrence Mh ≥ 2Mh 2 ≥ 22Mh 4 ≥ 4Mh 4 ≥ 42Mh 6 ≥ 8Mh 6 ≥ 2jMh 2j We could prove this by induction on j but well accept it on faith let j h2 ≥ 2h2Mh h ≥ 2h2M0 Mh ≥ 2h2 So weve shown that the minimum number of nodes that can be present in an AVL tree of height h is at least 2h2 In reality its actually more than that but this gives us something useful to work with we can use this result to figure out what were really interested in which is the opposite what is the height of an AVL tree with n nodes Mh ≥ 2h2 log2Mh ≥ h2 2 log2Mh ≥ h Finally we see that for AVL trees of height h with the minimum number of nodes the height is no more than 2 log2n where n is the number of nodes in the tree For AVL trees with more than the minimum number of nodes the relationship between the number of nodes and the height is even
